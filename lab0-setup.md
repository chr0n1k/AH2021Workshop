# Lab0: Setup



This is ideally to be done before the workshop begins so that we can dive into the code and break things down.

For this workshop you will need the following:

1. A Windows VM with Visual Studio .Net development installed with Defender turned off, or with an exclusion added to the folder where we will be developing our projects. In addition to this, the VM should have the following installed:&#x20;
2. Notepad++&#x20;
3. Process Hacker2&#x20;
4. dnSpy&#x20;
5. ConfuserEx
6. A Kali VM.
