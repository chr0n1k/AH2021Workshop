# Malware development workshop.

Welcome to the Malware Development workshop for AfricaHackon 2021. In this interactive workshop, we will take a look at the C# language and how to write malware focused on droppers/loaders that will run shellcode on Windows 10 targets that give a meterpreter session back.

The flow of this workshop is building out the code like how virus research looks at Gain of Function. We start of with a simple shellcode runner and build out from there.
