# Welcome to the Malware Development workshop.

Congratulations! You made it to the workshop gitbook! Welcome on board! In this interactive workshop, we will take a look at the C# language and how we can leverage its reflective capabilities for fun and profit!

This workshop was designed to be as accessible as possible, even if you have never touched C# before. However, to achieve the optimal benefits of this workshop, it is advised that you are at least familiar with an object-oriented programming language.&#x20;

Last but not least, have fun! In case you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out.
