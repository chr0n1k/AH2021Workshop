# Welcome to the Malware Development workshop.

## Welcome aboard!

Congratulations! You made it to the workshop gitbook! Welcome on board!
In this interactive workshop, we will take a look at the C# language and how we can leverage its reflective capabilities for fun and profit! 
&#x20;
This workshop was designed to be as accessible as possible, even if you have never touched C# before. However, to achieve the optimal benefits of this workshop, it is advised that you are at least familiar with an object-oriented programming language. Knowing your way around Visual Studio could come in handy as well, but is not necessarily required.
